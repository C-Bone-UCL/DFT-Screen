# DFT-Screen
### DFT Modelling of ML Generated Structures

Welcome to the weeklong summer research project! I hope this week can give a flavor of what its like to be postgrad researcher (although I myself am figuring things out every day). 

I've made some google colab notebooks to help take you through the week and (hopefully) get some interesting results and new useful skills.

Don't worry if stuff doesnt work, thats part of research. Send me an email or come to my desk any time and hopefully I can help out!
